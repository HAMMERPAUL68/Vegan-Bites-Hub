# Chilaquiles with Cashew Crema

**Country:** Mexico  
**Meal Type:** Breakfast

## Ingredients

### For the Chilaquiles
- 200 g corn tortillas, cut into triangles  
- 250 ml green salsa (salsa verde)  
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil  
- 1 small white onion, thinly sliced  
- 1 garlic clove, minced  
- 100 g cooked black beans (optional)  
- 50 g fresh cilantro, chopped  
- 1 avocado, sliced  
- Salt, to taste  

### For the Cashew Crema
- 100 g raw cashews, soaked in water for at least 4 hours or overnight  
- 120 ml water  
- 1 tbsp lime juice  
- 1 small garlic clove  
- 1/2 tsp salt  
```","## Method

1. **Prepare the Cashew Crema:** Drain and rinse the soaked cashews. In a blender, combine the cashews, 120 ml water, lime juice, garlic clove, and salt. Blend until smooth and creamy. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Onion and Garlic:** Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and minced garlic, saut√©ing until softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.

3. **Add the Salsa:** Pour the green salsa into the skillet with the onions and garlic. Stir well and let it simmer for 5 minutes to deepen the flavors.

4. **Fry the Tortilla Triangles:** In a separate pan, heat a little oil over medium-high heat. Fry the tortilla triangles in batches until they are crispy and golden, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove and drain on paper towels.

5. **Combine Tortillas and Salsa:** Add the fried tortilla triangles to the skillet with the salsa. Toss gently to coat all pieces evenly. Cook together for 2-3 minutes so the tortillas absorb some sauce but remain crisp.

6. **Add Beans (Optional):** If using cooked black beans, stir them into the skillet during the last minute of cooking to warm through.

7. **Serve:** Plate the chilaquiles and spoon the cashew crema over the top. Garnish with fresh cilantro and avocado slices. Add salt to taste and serve immediately.","```markdown
